Kyle has been in retrocomputing since he was a child. He enjoys coming up with new ways to use old hardware, not giving a toss about whatever the new hotness is in technology, and making cool things.

## What We Make

### AESIR

In addition to a variety of products designed by others, Studio 8502 is in the process of developing a 65816-compatible open hardware computer design, which will be available as both a DIY solderable kit and as a pre-assembled factory-made product. AESIR's basic architecture is as follows:

- WDC W65C265S CPU clocked at a minimum of 8MHz
- 512KB or more of RAM
- 512KB or more of flash ROM
- SD Card support
- Custom FabGL/ESP32-based graphics engine designed for retrogaming
- SNES controller support
- Open platform with full expansion bus
- Optional mechanical keyboard
- Simple-to-use GPIO "user port" for custom hardware and peripherals

AESIR is currently in prototyping, but on release, full schematics and Gerber files will be made available under an open license, and kits and premade versions will be for sale on our Tindie store.

### WME64

The WME64 is a ZiModem-based modem emulator for the Commodore C64, C128, and VIC-20, which uses modern wireless networking to get your retrocomputer on the Internet. It works as a standard user port modem, from 2400-9600 baud (depending on hardware limits).

### Custom C64 Cartridges

We also make custom ROM cartridges for the C64; these can contain any number of single-load .PRG files, up to a total of 1024KB, booting the C64 into a menu to select which file gets loaded into memory and run. These cartridges come in a custom-designed 3D printed case, with a large, full-colour label designed by the customer. 

### Third-Party Products

We also make and sell products designed by others where licenses permit. See our Tindie store for what's available at present, as the inventory changes often.
